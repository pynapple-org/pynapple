History
=======

This package somehow started about 20 years ago in Bruce McNaughton's lab. Dave Redish started the *TSToolbox* package in Matlab. 
Another postdoc in the lab, Francesco Battaglia, then made major contributions to the package. Francesco passed it on to Adrien Peyrache and other trainees in Paris and The Netherlands.
Around 2016-2017, Luke Sjulson started *TSToolbox2*, still in Matlab and which includes some important changes.

In 2018, Francesco started neuroseries, a Python package built on Pandas. It was quickly adopted in Adrien's lab, especially by Guillaume Viejo, a postdoc in the lab. Gradually, the majority of the lab was using it and new functions were constantly added.
In 2021, Guillaume and other trainees in Adrien's lab decided to fork from neuroseries and started *pynapple*. The core of pynapple is largely built upon neuroseries. Some of the original changes to TSToolbox made by Luke were included in this package, especially the *time_support* property of all ts/tsd objects.
