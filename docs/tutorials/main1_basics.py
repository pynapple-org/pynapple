# Numpy is for handling matrices and vector :
import numpy as np

# if no error, you can type to see for example the version :
print(np.__version__)
# Now let's declare a matrice of zeros of shape 3 by 3:
mymatrice1 = np.zeros((3, 3))
mymatrice1
# you can now see the shape of your matrice by doing
mymatrice1.shape
# let's declare a matrice of ones of shape 5 by 3
mymatrice2 = np.ones((5, 3))
# We can change the top left value by indexing mymatrice2 and assigning a new value
mymatrice2[0, 0] = 2.0
# IN PYTHON (AND IN ALL PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES EXCEPT MATLAB) INDEXING START AT 0
# so the bottom right element will be
mymatrice2[4, 2] = 4.0
# Observe the change by typing the name of your matrice
mymatrice2
# now try to change each value of your matrice independantly
# To declare a matrice of random values between 0 and 1 of shape 1 by 10
my_random_matrice = np.random.rand(10)
# To compute the average value of my random points
mean_value = np.mean(my_random_matrice)
# To compute the variance of my random points
var_value = np.var(my_random_matrice)


# Pandas is a cool package to handle big datasets
import pandas as pd

# let's put mymatrice2 in a pandas dataframe
my_panda = pd.DataFrame(data=mymatrice2)
# observe the difference when calling the variable
my_panda
# pandas shows the value inside the matrice but also the index along the two dimensions of the matrice
# We can change the index (if you haven't change the shape of mymatrice2)
my_panda = pd.DataFrame(
    data=mymatrice2,
    index=["Janvier", "Fevrier", "Mars", "Avril", "Mai"],
    columns=["Yes", "No", "Maybe"],
)
# What's happening in Fevrier?
my_panda.loc["Fevrier"]
# In Mai?
my_panda.loc["Mai"]
# For Maybe?
my_panda["Maybe"]
# No during Avril
my_panda.loc["Avril", "No"]
# Yes during Janvier and Mars
my_panda.loc[["Janvier", "Mars"], "Yes"]
# observe the use of .loc for line indexing and the use of the [] for multiple index

# Matplotlib to plot
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# let's plot a sinusoidal function
# first we declare the phase value between 0 and 4pi with a 0.01 step
phi = np.arange(0, 4 * np.pi, 0.01)
# let's declare a figure
plt.figure()
# and let's plot sin(phi)
plt.plot(phi, np.sin(phi), color="red")
# always label the axes
plt.xlabel("Phase")
plt.ylabel("Sinus")
# a title
plt.title("My plot")
# and display the figure
plt.show()
# no let's display a matrix
image = np.random.rand(20, 30)
plt.imshow(image)
plt.show()
