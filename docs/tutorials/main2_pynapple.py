# let's create fake data for example the time of 10 spikes between 0 and 15 s
random_times = np.random.uniform(0, 15, 10)
# let's sort them in ascending order of apparition
random_times = np.sort(random_times)
# we can include them in a neuroserie object called a Ts (Time series)
my_spike = nap.Ts(random_times, time_units="s")
# DON'T FORGET THE time_units otherwise it will consider you have spikes in microseconds
# Observe your dataset
my_spike
# The first column indicates the timestamps in seconds
# The second column is full of NaN (Not A Number) because it's just time stamps
# Let's try with spikes with milliseconds timestamps
my_spike2 = nap.Ts(random_times, time_units="ms")
# Observe the difference between the 2
my_spike
my_spike2
# SO REMEMBER
# ALWAYS CHECK THAT YOUR TIME UNITS ARE CORRECT!


# If you have timestamps associated with a value for example 15 points of EEG during 15seconds
my_eeg = np.sin(np.arange(0, 15))
# You use a Tsd (Time series data)
my_eeg = nap.Tsd(t=np.arange(15), d=my_eeg, time_units="s")
# Observe your variable
my_eeg
# And how the software transform you timetamps in second in timestamps in microsecond
# You can plot your data
plot(my_eeg, "o-")
show()

# Now if you are using a fancy probe and recording for example 3 channel at the same times
# You use a TsdFrame
my_channels = np.random.rand(15, 3)
my_channels = nap.TsdFrame(t=np.arange(15), d=my_channels, time_units="s")
# You can plot your data
# It's always important to look at your data in the eyes
plot(my_channels, "o-")
show()
# Yes it's random...


# If I want the data of my recording between second 5 to second 12

# Observe with the difference of colors how you took only a subpart
# But defining subpart like that is tedious
# And here comes the IntervaSet which basically does the same
# For example the first and last 5 second are rem sleep, 5 to 10 s is wake
my_rem = nap.IntervalSet(start=[0, 10], end=[5, 15], time_units="s")
# Same for wake
my_wake = nap.IntervalSet(start=[5], end=[10], time_units="s")
# Observe the different variables by typing them in the terminal
my_rem
my_wake

# What are the spike that occurs during rem sleep?
spike_during_rem = my_spike.restrict(my_rem)
# What is the value of the eeg during wake?
eeg_during_wake = my_eeg.restrict(my_wake)
# What is the value of the channels during both wake and rem
wake_and_rem = my_wake.union(my_rem)
channels_wake_rem = my_channels.restrict(wake_and_rem)

# How to remove the first 2 second of the wake_and_rem interval :
to_remove = nap.IntervalSet(start=[0], end=[2], time_units="s")
wake_and_rem = wake_and_rem.set_diff(to_remove)
