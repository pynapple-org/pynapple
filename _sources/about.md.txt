# About us

## History


This package somehow started about 20 years ago in Bruce McNaughton's lab. David Redish started the *TSToolbox* package in Matlab. 
Another postdoc in the lab, Francesco Battaglia, then made major contributions to the package. Francesco passed it on to Adrien Peyrache and other trainees in Paris and The Netherlands.
Around 2016-2017, Luke Sjulson started *TSToolbox2*, still in Matlab and which includes some important changes.

In 2018, Francesco Battaglia started neuroseries, a Python package built on Pandas. It was quickly adopted by Guillaume Viejo, a postdoc in Adrien Peyrache lab at McGill university. Gradually, the majority of the lab was using it and new functions were constantly added.
In 2021, Guillaume Viejo, Adrien Peyrache and other trainees decided to fork from neuroseries and started *pynapple*. 
The core of pynapple is largely built upon neuroseries. Some of the original changes to the TSToolbox made by Luke Sjulson were included in this package, especially the *time_support* property of all ts/tsd objects.

Since 2023, the development of pynapple is lead by [Guillaume Viejo](https://www.simonsfoundation.org/people/guillaume-viejo/), [Edoardo Balzani](https://www.simonsfoundation.org/people/edoardo-balzani/) and 
Sarah Jo Venditto at the Center for Computational Neuroscience of the Flatiron institute.

## Special Credits

Special thanks to Francesco P. Battaglia
(<https://github.com/fpbattaglia>) for the development of the original
*TSToolbox* (<https://github.com/PeyracheLab/TStoolbox>) and
*neuroseries* (<https://github.com/NeuroNetMem/neuroseries>) packages,
the latter constituting the core of *pynapple*.
